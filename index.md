## Install Processing

Pay attention to where you install it.

## Java CLASSPATH

You need to set the environment variable `CLASSPATH`.

## Processing and the `PApplet` class

Processing embeds everything into a Java class.

[HelloProcessing.java](HelloProcessing.java)

## Using external classes

You need to give other classes a reference to the `PApplet` class.  

[HelloProcessing2.java](HelloProcessing2.java)  
[Ball.java](Ball.java)


## Applications

Graphics programming is a natural place to use object oriented programming
techniques, e.g. the `Ball` class in the `HelloProcessing2` example.

__2D array application: image processing__

[ImageProcessing.java](ImageProcessing.java)

__Recursion application: fractals__
